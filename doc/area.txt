[!]image sensor, horizontal position, vertical position, width, height

!
	

Defines an area that is excluded from analysis (this area should always be inside of the area that is to be analyzed).

Image sensor
	

Selects the image sensor (camera image) to use for this window definition:

    0: Right camera image on dual cameras, default setting on mono cameras.

    1: Left camera image on dual cameras.

Horizontal position
	

Number of pixels measured from the left edge of the visible image to the left border of the window (based on a MEGA image 1280x960).

Vertical position
	

Number of pixels measured from the bottom edge of the visible image to the bottom border of the window (based on a MEGA image 1280x960).

Width
	

Width of the window in pixels (based on a MEGA image 1280x960).

Height
	

Height of the window in pixels (based on a MEGA image 1280x960).

Horizontal Coordinate
	

Number of pixels measured horizontally from the left edge of the visible image to the polygon corner (based on a MEGA image 1280x960).

Vertical Coordinate
	

Number of pixels measured vertically from the bottom edge of the visible image to the polygon corner (based on a MEGA image 1280x960).
